## About

This project is the front-end component of a larger project called "NC News" that creates a very basic version of a forum where users write articles within certain topics, and other users can comment on said articles. This is not supposed to be a project that actually has practical working-value, but instead to be a means to showcase skills that I have learnt through my time at Northcoders bootcamp.

This project is linked to the back-end version, available here: https://github.com/DavidCobb606/Backend-project

## Running

To run this, make sure you have React installed:

```npm i react```

Then simply run:

```npm run start```
